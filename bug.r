# This code attempts to subset a data frame using a logical condition that results in an unexpected behavior.

df <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = letters[1:5])

# Incorrect subsetting: This will return an empty data frame because the condition is never met.
subset_df <- df[df$a > 5, ]

# The expected behavior is to subset the data frame where column 'a' is greater than 0.
# However, using a logical condition incorrectly may produce a different behavior than expected. 
# This is especially challenging to debug when dealing with large data frames and complex conditions.
